title: about

Hi, I'm Chris, thanks for reaching my website! I started this static
site to learn more about hosting content on the web, and sharing
things that others may also find interesting.

I'm currently working as a data engineer at
[FocusCura](https://www.focuscura.nl), where I work on the Business
Process Automation team.

When I'm not working on fuel cells at my day job, you can usually find
me climbing, dancing, reading, or volunteering with the wonderful
[Rotaract Amsterdam](https://rotaractamsterdam.nl) organization.
