Hi, I'm Chris, thanks for reaching my website! I started this static site to
learn more about hosting content on the web, and sharing things that I think
are interesting.

I'm currently working as a data engineer at [DataChef](https://datachef.co), a
boutique big data consultancy, based in Amsterdam. We are specialists in
helping modern marketing and sales teams by demystifying data and simplifying
information for them.

Outside of work, you can usually find me climbing, dancing, reading, or
volunteering with the [Rotaract Amsterdam](https://rotaractamsterdam.nl)
organization.
