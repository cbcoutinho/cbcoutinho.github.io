title: about

Hi, I'm Chris, thanks for reaching my website! I started this static
site to learn more about hosting content on the web, and sharing
things that others may also find interesting.

I'm currently working as a data analyst and researcher at
[REDstack](https://www.redstack.nl), where I work on a team developing
reverse electrodialysis, a novel fuel cell technology powered by
mixing fresh and salt water.

When I'm not working on fuel cells at my day job, you can usually find
me climbing, dancing, reading, or volunteering with the wonderful
[Rotaract Amsterdam](https://rotaractamsterdam.nl) organization.
