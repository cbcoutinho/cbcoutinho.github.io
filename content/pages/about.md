title: about

Hi, I'm Chris, thanks for reaching my website! I started this static
site to learn more about hosting content on the web, and sharing
things that I think are interesting.

I'm currently working as a data engineer at
[FocusCura](https://www.focuscura.nl), where I work on the Business
Process Automation team.

When I'm not working on organizing data in health-care at my day job, you can
usually find me climbing, dancing, reading, or volunteering with the impactful
[Rotaract Amsterdam](https://rotaractamsterdam.nl) organization.
